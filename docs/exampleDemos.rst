This section provides a series of workflows that demonstrate the 
core functionality of AmpScan. Some require sample stl 
files - these can be downloaded from the Gitlab repository `here`_. 
If you are using a git clone you can make the module importable 
via ``import AmpScan`` by navigating to the root directory and running 
``pip install -e .``.
