# AmpScan

## Getting Started

Would be nice to have a "Hello AmpScan" type function described here.

## Building Docs Locally

The documentation was generated using [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/index.html) which provides 
a [makefile](../docs/Makefile). This enables documentation to be generated with a single command.

1. Clone the repository onto your local machine.
2. Open a command prompt (anaconda) in the docs directory.
3. Type `make html` and press enter.

The documentation files will be generated in docs/_build/html. Note that one error should be produced during 
the make process - this is expected and can be ignored.
